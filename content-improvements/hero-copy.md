## Second Section: The Problem
### "Why You're Always Exhausted (Hint: It's Not Your Fault)"

Most advice assumes all brains work the same way. They don't.

Whether you have ADHD, autism, high sensitivity, or just feel different, your brain has unique needs for:
- **Stimulation levels** - Too much or too little drains you
- **Recovery methods** - Rest might not mean "doing nothing" for you
- **Energy cycles** - Your peaks and valleys follow different patterns
- **Stress responses** - What calms others might exhaust you

Traditional personality tests miss this completely. They put you in a box. We show you your spectrum.

## Third Section: The Solution
### "Finally, a System Designed for Brain Diversity"

**Honors Your Wiring**
Designed with neurodivergent brains in mind, validated by 12,000+ diverse thinkers

**Provides Practical Tools**
Specific strategies for YOUR element mix, not generic advice that doesn't fit

**Grows With You**
Tracks your four states (biological, societal, passion, survival) as you evolve

## FAQ Reframe
### "Common Questions from Diverse Thinkers"

**"Is this only for neurodivergent people?"**
No! While designed with neurodivergent brains in mind, NeuroElemental helps anyone who's felt misunderstood by traditional systems. Think of it like curb cuts—designed for wheelchairs, helpful for everyone with wheels.

**"How is this different from MBTI or Enneagram?"**
Those systems put you in a fixed box. We map your energy patterns across different contexts. You're not "an Electric type"—you have Electric energy that shows up differently when you're stressed, passionate, or adapting.

**"What if I don't have a diagnosis?"**
You don't need one! Brain diversity exists on a spectrum. If you've felt different, struggled with traditional advice, or experienced cycles of burnout, this framework can help you understand why.

**"Is this scientifically valid?"**
Yes. Built on 20+ peer-reviewed studies in neuroscience, polyvagal theory, and energy regulation. We're transparent about our methodology and limitations—check our Science page for full citations.
